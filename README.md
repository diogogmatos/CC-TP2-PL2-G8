# üåê CC-TP2-PL2-G8

As a project for the 2023/2024 **Computer Communications** course (**Software Engineering B.Sc.**), we built a custom **torrent-like Peer-to-Peer (PTP) application**. The project's main challenge was the design of two bespoke application layer protocols: TCPombo (TCP-based) and UDPombo (UDP-based). These protocols, playfully named after the Portuguese term for homing pigeon ("pombo correio"), form the reliable backbone of our PTP communication system.
